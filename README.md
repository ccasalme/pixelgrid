# pixelgrid
experiment repo

## Purpose:

A full-stack app that consists of a client, the front-end, and a server, the back-end.

This is a back-end that stores the pixels of a digital canvas.

The front-end that displays the digital canvas, lets the users draw on it simultaneously.

### Note:
This experiment repo is currently running on Express SQL (since this was initially built through the MIMO app). However, we can change this into Posgres SQL (and we should)
