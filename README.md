This is a back-end that stores the pixels of a digital canvas.

The front-end that displays the digital canvas, lets the users draw on it simultaneously.

### Note:
- This experiment repo is currently running on Express SQL (since this was initially built by me through the MIMO app). However, we can change this into Posgres SQL (and we should)

- See Issues of what must be done in order to get this running in a different environment from the Mimo App
